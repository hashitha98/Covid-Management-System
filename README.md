Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the main body in managing the pandemic situations such as COVID-19 in Sri Lanka. With the help of the ministry of health and Public Health Inspectors (PHI) the CDC is planning to establish an internet service where the citizens can report their locations when they are moving one place to another.
